## How I got here

- My background: systems engineering.
- Specialised in CI/CD, automation, and private cloud. 
- Linux, Python, Ansible, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes.
- Transitioned to cybersecurity.
- Recruited by a cybersecurity consultancy into Digital Engineering.
- Mostly focus on DevSecOps, cloud security, and zero trust secrets management.
- Upskill in vendor-specific technologies: Kubernetes, HashiCorp, etc.

Note:

You don't need to have a cybersecurity background to get into cybersecurity. You can leverage your existing skills and experience to transition into the field. In fact, having a diverse background can be an advantage as it allows you to close the gap between cybersecurity and business operations.

I work mostly in the DevSecOps space, which is the intersection of development, operations, and security. In a consultancy, you will need to be able to be able to demonstrate your expertise in a selection of vendor-specific technologies. It would help tremedously if you can get certified in these technologies before you start.

However, certifications can only help you get your foot in the door. They are not a substitute for real-world experience. You will need to continuously learn and adapt to stay relevant in the field. A home lab can be a great way to experiment.

## What I do

- Help organisations to secure their digital assets.
- Automate security controls and compliance.
- Secure software development lifecycle.
- Secure cloud infrastructure.
- Secure secrets management.
- Design and implement zero trust architecture.

Note:

I focus mostly on secret and certificate management. Usually, I work with HashiCorp Vault, CyberArk, and automation tools like Ansible, Terraform, Github, Gitlab and Jenkins. I also work with Kubernetes and Docker to secure containerised workloads.

CI/CD is a now increasingly important part of the software development lifecycle. It allows developers to deliver code faster and more reliably. However, it also introduces new security challenges, especially around secrets management. Everybody wants to ship code faster, but nobody wants to deal with the security aftermath of a breach.

Usually a business will have a overarching security policy that they request you to implement. You will need to understand the business context and translate that into technical requirements. They will also have a budget that you will need to work within. This mean the best solution is not always the most secure solution. You will need to balance security with usability and cost.

This is where negotiation and communication skills come into play. You will need to be able to explain complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders and business owners. You will also need to be able to translate business requirements into technical requirements for developers.

## What I have learned

- Your audience is not just the technical team.
- You need to communicate with stakeholders, business owners, and developers.
- You need to understand the business context.
- You need to be able to translate technical jargon into business language.
- Documentation is key.
- Avoid being a gatekeeper, you are an enabler.

Note:

Most of the time, your engagement will start with a business owner who has a problem that they need you to solve. You might not always have direct access to the technical team, so you will need to be able to explain complex technical concepts in a way that non-technical stakeholders can understand.

This is where you will need to understand the business context. You will need to be able to explain the technical implications of business decisions to business owners. Negotiation and communication skills are the key. You do not want to be seen as a roadblock to progress; however, you also need to ensure that the business is aware of the risks that they are taking and put your foot down when necessary.

This is where documentation comes into play. You will need to document your decisions and the reasons behind them. This is not only for compliance reasons, but also to ensure that you can refer back to them when you need to explain your decisions to the business.

At the same time, you need to be an enabler. Good security is not about saying no to everything. It is about finding a way to say yes in a secure way. Business owners might have a different goal than the technical team. You will need to find a way to balance these goals and ensure that the business can operate securely.

Let works a true scenario, the development team wants to ship code faster, but the business owner wants to ensure that the production environment secret is logged and audited. A bad solution would be to create a form that the developer needs to fill out every time they need a secret. An enabler solution would be to automate the secret retrieval process and log the secret retrieval process.

You will also need to communicate different value propositions to different stakeholders. In the above example, you would communicate to the business owner that the secrets are logged and audited, while you would communicate to the development team that they can retrieve secrets faster.

Remember, you will need to walk a fine line between security, usability, and cost. Saying no to everything will not make you popular. You will have a difficult time getting buy-in from the business and become a trust advisor.
