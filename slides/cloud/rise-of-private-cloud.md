## The Rise of Private Cloud

---

### Public Cloud is Cool

- Cost-Efficiency
- Scalability
- Self-service and Agility
- Automation

Note:

- *Cost-Efficiency:* Significant cost savings on infrastructure, maintenance, and operations.
- *Scalability:* One of the key benefits of cloud is the ability for developers to provision their own resources, accelerating development cycles.
- *Self-service and Agility:* Enabling developers to make decisions about the resources they use.
- *Automation:* The ability to design self-healing infrastructure, automatic scaling, and streamlined resource provisioning.

## Public Cloud Drawbacks

- Digital Sovereign.
- Cost Unpredictability.
- Compliance and Security Challenges.
- Lack of Control and Customisation.

Note: 

- *Digital Sovereign:* A country's government will suddenly change its policies or sudden trade embargo, impacting the ability to operate or access data in that country. Eg: in China, strict data sovereignty laws require that data generated in the country must stay in the country. Or recently, AWS has stopped taking new AWS customers in Russia.
- *Cost Unpredictability:* While public clouds operate on a pay-as-you-go model, which can be cost-effective, they can also lead to unpredictable costs. The vendor might decide to change their pricing structure, complicating the budgeting process. Eg: AWS EC2 price hike. Teams might also accidentally leave resources running, which can lead to unexpected costs.
- *Compliance and Security Challenges:* While many public cloud providers offer tools and certifications to help with compliance, it might be difficult to be fully in compliance of an infrastructure you cannot control. Eg: GDPR, HIPAA, ISM control. Data might accidentally get exposed during testing and production.
- *Lack of Control and Customisation:* With a public cloud, organisations have less control over their infrastructure and data. The cloud provider manages the underlying hardware and software, which can limit customisation and may not meet specific needs. Eg: GPU, TPU, hardware accelerators.
