Note:

The reality is private cloud market is smaller compare to public cloud. Public clouds, operated by tech giants like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, have a global reach with massive resources. The scale of their operations far exceeds that of most private clouds, allowing them to provide a breadth of services that most organisations can't match in-house.

Public clouds also have vast quantities of resources available, which can be allocated and de-allocated on demand. This level of elasticity is generally not feasible with a private cloud due to the constraints of on-premise hardware.

### Why private cloud?

_Identify the following_
1. Data Security and Compliance
2. Resource Usage
3. Budget and Cost Predictability
4. In-House Expertise
5. Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery
6. Long-term Strategy

Note:

Consider these key questions to help assess whether a private cloud is the optimal solution for your organisation:

1. **Data Security and Compliance**: Does your company handle sensitive data requiring stringent security measures or compliance with specific regulations (e.g., HIPAA for healthcare, PCI DSS for payment card information)? Do you have sovereign requirements you need to address?
2. **Resource Usage**: Do you have a clear and predictable pattern of resource usage? Can your needs be efficiently met by a dedicated infrastructure rather than the on-demand scalability of a public cloud?   
3. **Budget and Cost Predictability**: Does your budget allow for the initial investment required for a private cloud setup? Would a predictable cost structure be more beneficial for your financial planning than a pay-as-you-go model?
4. **In-House Expertise**: Does your IT team have the skills and capacity to manage a private cloud? This includes tasks like maintaining hardware, updating software, managing security, and troubleshooting issues.
5. **Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery**: Do you have a plan for business continuity and disaster recovery? Can a private cloud support these plans, or could a public or hybrid cloud provide a better solution?
6. **Long-term Strategy**: How does a private cloud align with your company's long-term strategy? Does it provide the flexibility and scalability you need for future growth and changes in your business?
