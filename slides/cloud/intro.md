## What is *Cloud Computing?*

---

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet ("the cloud") instead of using local servers or personal devices.

---

### Core Benefits

- Cost-Efficiency
- Scalability
- Self-service and Agility
- Automation and Efficiency

Note:

- *Cost-Efficiency:* Significant cost savings on infrastructure, maintenance, and operations.
- *Scalability:* One of the key benefits of cloud is the ability for developers to provision their own resources, accelerating development cycles.
- *Self-service and Agility:* Enabling developers to make decisions about the resources they use.
- *Automation and Efficiency:* In the cloud, provisioning of infrastructure such as servers, storage, and networking can be fully automated. This means that users can request and receive access to resources on-demand, without the need for manual intervention by IT staff.

## Types of Cloud Services

---

### Software as a Service (SaaS)

- Enables users to access applications hosted on a cloud infrastructure.
- Users can use web browsers or program interfaces to access these applications.
- Users are not responsible for managing the underlying cloud infrastructure.

Note:

Definition:
The capability provided to the consumer is to use the provider’s applications running on a cloud infrastructure. The applications are accessible from various client devices through either a thin client interface, such as a web browser (e.g., web-based email), or a program interface. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, storage, or even individual application capabilities, with the possible exception of limited user-specific application configuration settings.

Source(s):
NIST SP 800-145

Examples: email, calendar, and office tools (such as Microsoft Office 365).

---

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)

- Consumer deploys their applications on cloud infrastructure using supported tools.
- Consumer do not manage the underlying cloud infrastructure, including network, servers, and storage.
- Consumer have control over deployed applications and configuration settings.

Note:

Definition:
The capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure consumer-created or acquired applications created using programming languages, libraries, services, and tools supported by the provider. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, or storage, but has control over the deployed applications and possibly configuration settings for the application-hosting environment.

Source(s):
NIST SP 800-145

Examples:
Heroku, Vercel, Cloud Foundry.

---

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

- Consumer can provision processing, storage, and networking resources.
- They can deploy and run arbitrary software, including operating systems and applications.
- Consumer has control over operating systems, storage, deployed applications, and limited control over select networking components.

Note:

Definition:
The capability provided to the consumer is to provision processing, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources where the consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software, which can include operating systems and applications. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems, storage, and deployed applications; and possibly limited control of select networking components (e.g., host firewalls).

Source(s):
NIST SP 800-145

## Types of Cloud Deployment

---

### Public Cloud

- Services are delivered over the internet and shared among multiple users.
- Examples include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure.

---

### Private Cloud

- Services are delivered over a private IT infrastructure.
- Dedicated use of a single organisation.
- Can be physically located at the organization’s on-site data center or hosted by a third-party service provider.

---

### Hybrid Cloud

- Combines public and private clouds
- Allowing data and applications to be shared between them for greater flexibility and more deployment options.
