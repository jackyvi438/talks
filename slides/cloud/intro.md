## What is *Cloud Computing?*

---

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet ("the cloud") instead of using local servers or personal devices.

---

### Core Benefits

- *Cost-Efficiency:* Cost savings on infrastructure, maintenance by sharing hardware resources.
- *Scalability:* Easy to scale up or down based on demand.
- *Empowering Developers:* Enabling developers to make decisions about the resources they use.

## Types of Cloud Services

---

### Software as a Service (SaaS)

Cloud-based applications are provided to the user, as a service on demand. Ready to use.

Examples: email, calendar, and office tools (such as Microsoft Office 365).

---

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)

The customer create and deploy applications created using programming languages, libraries, services, and tools supported by the provider.

Consumer does not manage or control the underlying network, servers, operating systems, or storage.

Examples: Heroku, Vercel, Cloud Foundry.

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

Provides the infrastructure such as virtual machines and other resources like virtual-machine disk image library, block and file-based storage, firewalls, load balancers, IP addresses, virtual local area networks, etc.

---

## Types of Cloud Deployment

---

### Public Cloud

Services are delivered over the internet and shared among multiple users. Examples include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure.

---

### Private Cloud

Services are delivered over a private IT infrastructure for the dedicated use of a single organisation. This can be physically located at the organizationâ€™s on-site data center or hosted by a third-party service provider.

---

### Hybrid Cloud

Combines public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them for greater flexibility and more deployment options.
