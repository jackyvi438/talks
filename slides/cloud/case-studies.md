### OpenStack at CERN

---

### Introduction to CERN

- CERN is a leading global research organisation focused on high-energy physics.
- The World Wide Web was invented at CERN in 1989.
- It operates the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the world's largest particle accelerator.
- CERN's collaboration with scientists worldwide and generated a massive volume of data its experiments.

### Challenges Faced by CERN

- [CERN generates petabytes of data](https://home.cern/resources/faqs/facts-and-figures-about-lhc) from particle collisions, requiring immense computing power for analysis.
- Traditional data center environments couldn't meet the scalability and flexibility demands of CERN's research.
- Scientific research at CERN is dynamic, with evolving objectives and requirements. They needed a flexible infrastructure that could provide a wide range of services.

Note:
CERN Data Centre stores more than 30 petabytes of data per year from the LHC experiments. Over 100 petabytes of data are permanently archived, on tape.

### OpenStack at CERN

- CERN developed a private cloud infrastructure based on OpenStack.
- The OpenStack cloud provides a flexible choice of compute, storage, and networking resources.
- OpenStack allows CERN to provide a large service catalog to its users, including virtual machines, block storage, containers, container ochestration, object storage, and databases.
