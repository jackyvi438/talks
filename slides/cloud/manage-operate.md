## Management Options

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?
- Telemetry and Continuous load testing?
- Service Automation?
- Alert Monitoring?

Note:
- *Infrastructure as Code (IaC)*: When operating at scale automation of infrastructure management tasks, such as provisioning, configuration, and deployment are essential. With IaC, your infrastructure becomes reproducible and version-controlled, just like your application code. Tools such as Terraform, Ansible, and Chef can be used to implement IaC, allowing for rapid, consistent, and repeatable creation and teardown of environments. Avoid manual configuration of infrastructure, as this can lead to inconsistencies and errors.
- *Telelmetry and Continuous load testing*: When operating at scale, it is essential to have a good understanding of the health and performance of your infrastructure. This can be achieved through the use of telemetry and continuous monitoring. Telemetry is the collection of data from your infrastructure, such as CPU and memory usage, network traffic, and application logs. Continuous monitoring is the analysis of this data to identify trends and potential issues. Tools such as Prometheus and Grafana can be used to implement telemetry and continuous monitoring.
