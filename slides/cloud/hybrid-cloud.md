## Hybrid Cloud

---

### Why Hybrid Cloud?

- Flexibility and Scalability
- Cost Optimisation
- Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity

Note:
- *Flexibility and Scalability*: Hybrid cloud offers the flexibility to scale resources up or down based on fluctuating demands. It allows organisations to leverage the agility and scalability of public cloud for non-sensitive workloads, while keeping critical data and applications within a private cloud for enhanced security and control.
- *Cost Optimisation*:  Hybrid cloud enables organisations to optimise costs by leveraging public cloud for less sensitive or temporary workloads, reducing the need for dedicated infrastructure. It allows for cost-efficient resource allocation, avoiding unnecessary hardware investments and minimising operational expenses.
- *Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity*: Hybrid cloud facilitates robust disaster recovery and business continuity strategies. Organisations can leverage public cloud for backup and recovery purposes while keeping critical systems running on-premises or in a private cloud, ensuring data redundancy and minimizing downtime.

### Why not Hybrid Cloud?

- Complexity
- Data Integration and Interoperability
- Increased Management Overhead

Note:
- *Complexity*: Managing a hybrid cloud environment involves dealing with the complexity of integrating and orchestrating different cloud models and infrastructure. It requires expertise in multiple cloud architecture, networking, and security.
- *Data Integration and Interoperability*: Moving data between public and private cloud environments can present challenges in terms of data integration, consistency, and interoperability.
- *Increased Management Overhead*: Hybrid cloud requires managing multiple cloud environments. IT teams need to oversee multiple platforms, monitor performance, manage security, and ensure consistent governance across the entire hybrid cloud infrastructure.

### How to Hybrid Cloud?

- Generally a bad idea
- Strict data boundaries
- Cloud-native containerised applications
- Target lowest common denominator

Note:
- *Generally a bad idea*: Hybrid cloud is generally a bad idea. It is complex, expensive, and difficult to manage. It is best to avoid it if possible.
- *Strict data boundaries*: If you must use hybrid cloud, ensure strict data boundaries between the public and private cloud environments. This will help minimise data integration and interoperability issues.
- *Cloud-native containerised applications*: Use cloud-native containerised applications to ensure consistency across different cloud environments.
- *Target lowest common denominator*: Target the lowest common denominator when designing applications. This will help minimise data integration and interoperability issues.
